## Problem Statement  

The challenge: Allocate a total budget \( B \) across multiple marketing channels \({ B_1, ..., B_n }\) to maximize revenue \( R \).  

### Key Issues  
- Channels such as Google Ads and Facebook Ads require detailed optimization, while others (e.g., SEO, Email) are treated as fixed investments.  
- Non-linearities in budget-to-revenue relationships complicate the process.  

The solution involves:  
1. **Predictive Modeling**: Forecast revenue based on budget allocation.  
2. **Optimization Algorithms**: Find the ideal allocation of \( B \) across channels.

---

## Approach  

### 1. **Time Series Models**  
Predict revenue using historical data for each channel.  
- **Data Intervals**: Daily and monthly aggregated data provide the foundation for modeling.  
- **Techniques**: Models such as RNNs, HMMs, or even linear regression establish relationships between budgets and revenues.

### 2. **Optimization Strategy**  
Leverage predictive models to allocate budgets optimally.  
- **Revenue Functions**: \( Rev(B) \) for each campaign is developed based on historical performance.  
- **Optimization Algorithms**: Utilize non-convex approaches like genetic algorithms or colony optimization.
